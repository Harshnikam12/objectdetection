Obejct Detection using Deep Learning

Introduction

This project implements an advanced object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, a real-time object detection framework. Built with TensorFlow, the project leverages the Darknet53 backbone for feature extraction and includes components like batch normalization, fixed padding, and upsampling to support accurate and efficient detection. The primary goal is to provide a robust and scalable solution for detecting objects in images or video streams in real-time.

Overview
Framework: TensorFlow, indicating a focus on neural network implementation.
Primary Functions:
Batch Normalization: A function to standardize layer inputs for stable and efficient training.
Fixed Padding: Adds consistent padding to inputs, crucial for convolutional operations.
Convolutional Layers: Functions like conv2d_fixed_padding implement 2D convolutions with specific configurations.
Darknet53 Backbone: This is a residual block-based neural network for feature extraction, commonly used in object detection.
YOLO Components: Functions like yolo_convolution_block and yolo_layer suggest the project implements the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection architecture.
Upsampling: Increases feature map dimensions, a critical step in the YOLO detection pipeline.
